## On K5 by Fujitsu

We recommend using [K5 PaaS CF](http://www.fujitsu.com/global/solutions/cloud/k5/paas/) by which you can easily deploy the application.

### Preparation

1. Deploy following buildpacks. ([CF Document](https://cf-docs.jp-east-1.paas.cloud.global.fujitsu.com/en/manual/tut/tut/topics/c-service-catalog-deploy.html))
    * Node.js buildpack for the backend application
    * Static file buildpack for the frontend application

2. Configure the CLI tool for CF. ([CF Document](https://cf-docs.jp-east-1.paas.cloud.global.fujitsu.com/en/manual/tut/tut/topics/t-dev-pre-cf.html))

### Deployment

#### Backend application
1. Set node engine property of `package.json`.
Please change the property to a proper version for your environment. Especially for [UK region](https://cf-docs.jp-east-1.paas.cloud.global.fujitsu.com/en/manual/release/basic.html) users, please change it to '6.x' because of the buildpack which supports only for v6.3.x.
```json@package.json
  "engines": {
    "node": "6.9.4"
  },
```

2. Deploy the backend application.

    ```sh
    cd [APP_DIR]/backend
    vi config.js # If you need to change the configuration of backend.
    cf push [YOUR_BACKEND_APPLICATION_NAME]
    ```

#### Frontend application

1. Build the frontend application.

    ```sh
    cd [APP_DIR]/frontend
    export API_URL=[BACKEND_URL]
    npm install
    npm run build
    ```

2. Deploy the frontend application

    ```sh
    cd [APP_DIR]/frontend/public
    cf push [YOUR_FRONTEND_APPLICATION_NAME]
    ```

## **MODIFY! MODIFY! MODIFY!**
Not to mention that, it's just out of a template. Better you modify, finner your application become. So let's play with it.
